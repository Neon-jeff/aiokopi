As a social blockchain, the network values true humanness and therefore has strict measures such as mandatory KYC before Mainnet migration. Bot accounts are not allowed to benefit from a Pi account, and only one account is allowed per person.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Real human Pioneers contribute in diverse ways for the network&#8217;s overall security, growth and inclusion, utilities creation, and stability and longevity. Therefore, the account safety of Pioneers is of paramount importance for individual Pioneers and the network as a whole.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pi Network has grown to over 33 million engaged Pioneers within the Enclosed Network period of Mainnet. The network size and the general enthusiasm and goodwill of Pioneers may attract unwanted scammers. These bad actors can claim to involve the Pi Core Team or its founders and try to harm Pioneers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pi-cryptocurrency-is-currently-not-for-sale\">Pi Cryptocurrency is Currently Not for Sale<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that Pi is mined for free on the mobile app through contributions to the ecosystem, but it is currently NOT for sale. Pi Network is NOT running an ICO or any type of crowdfunding sales of Pi coins.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pi Network is NOT affiliated with anyone or any organization claiming to sell or create Pi (sometimes referred to as &#8216;Pi Coin&#8217; or &#8216;PiCoin&#8217; by Pioneers), Pi futures, Pi NFTs, Pi airdrops, or any other derivatives of Pi. All such sales are unauthorized and may lead to your loss of money or personal data. Pi is currently not on any trading or futures exchanges or traded for other currencies\/cryptocurrencies, including any decentralized exchanges.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also, all previously mined Pi will only be claimable from inside the Pi App through the Mainnet dashboard and transferred into your Pi wallet after your KYC is verified and the network Mainnet migration is underway. Any website asking Pioneers to claim Pi through other means is fake.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-aware-of-false-associations-with-pi-network\">Be Aware of False Associations with Pi Network<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Be especially careful on social media for fake websites, misleading ads (ads to fake websites), fake email addresses, and other places where malicious actors can give Pioneers false impressions and false information. This includes unknown parties that co-opt the unauthorized use of Pi name (e.g., X-Pi, Pi-Y, etc.) and branding to make it seem as if Pi Network is affiliated with them in an official capacity. Some of these parties could potentially be a genuine contributor to the Pi ecosystem, but the names do not automatically imply an official partnership with Pi Network. These claims of partnership or affiliation are false unless otherwise expressly confirmed by our official communication channels listed below.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-safeguard-your-data\">Safeguard your Data<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Note that Pi Core Team members will NEVER ask you for your account password or your wallet passphrase under any circumstances. Pi Network will also NEVER ask you, outside the official Mining App and Pi Wallet interface, for your account password\u2014only the hashed version of which is stored on our servers, or your wallet passphrase that is never sent to our servers. So, Pi Network never has copies of your password or wallet passphrase.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-cautious-of-third-party-services\">Be Cautious of Third-party Services<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For your account&#8217;s safety, be cautious using any third-party services to access your Pi accounts. Malicious actors may provide seemingly legitimate services such as hosting Pi Nodes and\/or VPNs but may explicitly or secretly require Pioneers to share sensitive data including Pi account login credentials. These services may then be able to access your Pi account and perform actions such as appealing to change your name, changing the destination wallet address that receives your Pi in the Mainnet Migration, and changing your security circles members, which can potentially lead to a loss of your Pi or malicious deletion of your Pi account. Participating with these unverified parties to access your Pi account or run a Pi Node may lead to these services stealing all of your Pi.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you have experienced unexpected behavior in your Pi account, you should stop using such services, change your account password before going through KYC or migration to the Mainnet and file a report.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To file a report, you can visit your account profile page accessible through the \u2630 side menu, and tap\u00a0<strong>\u201cReport suspicious activity on my account\u201d<\/strong>. To change your account password, tap\u00a0<strong>\u201cReset Password\u201d<\/strong>\u00a0in your profile page, and use the phone number registered to your account to verify your reset request. By changing your password, your account on any other devices will also be automatically logged out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-official-pi-network-communication-channels\">Official Pi Network Communication Channels<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Please always rely on information provided by Pi Network&#8217;s official channels. Refer to the following safety link for a complete list of official Pi Network information sources.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-button gb-block-button\"><a class=\"gb-button gb-button-shape-rounded gb-button-size-medium\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #593b8b;\" href=\"\/safety\/\">Pi Safety<\/a><\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is an incredibly exciting time for Pi, and we want to make sure that all of our amazing Pioneers are safe from malicious actors.
